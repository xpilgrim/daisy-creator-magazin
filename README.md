daisy-creator-magazin
=====================

Create digital talking books of audio magazins for blind people in the daisy 2.02 standard.

Basics
------
The workflow is as follows:
- Record your articles with a digital recorder, like the marantz PMD 661
- The produced audiofiles are stored as mp3 in a flat struckture with numbered filenames up to 1000
- Mount the recordet media-card to your PC
- Now start the daisy-creator-magazin-application to create the daisy-fileset

If finished, you will find in the destinationfolder your audiofiles
and the daisy-structure for your daisy-player. 
The audiofiles are renamend like your metadata.

General work steps

1. Choose the folder of your recordet audiofiles as "Source-Folder"
2. Choose the folder for your dtb as "Destination-Folder"
3. Choose the title and number of your magazin
4. Select the options if necessary (see options-section)
5. Run "Copy"

Additional audiofiles-section

With this, you can load and insert in the daisystruckture one or two separate redordet audiofiles,
